RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  I have added subtle fade-in-up animations to the hero section's title, subtitle, and button group on the homepage.
outcome: Subtle fade-in-up animations were successfully added to the homepage hero section elements, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
evaluation: The agent successfully implemented the request for more effects and animations by adding CSS keyframe animations with staggered delays to the key elements of the hero section.
